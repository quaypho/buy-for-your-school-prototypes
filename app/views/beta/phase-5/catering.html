            html: "<p>When you're <a href="./first-steps/find-the-right-procurement-process.html">finding the right procurement process to follow</a>, you'll need to consider things like how much you're spending and how much time you have.</p>

            <h3 class=\"govuk-heading-s\">Lifetime cost of the catering contract</h3>

            <p>Catering contracts usually last 3 to 5 years, but that can vary. It's unlikely that the lifetime cost of the service will be low enough for you to choose a single supplier directly from a framework. You'll probably need to get at least 3 quotes, advertise a contract and run a procurement process, or run an EU compliant procurement process.</p>

            <p>There are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-a-dfe-approved-framework-for-your-school">3 catering services frameworks</a> available that you can use to run a mini competition, which involves asking 3 suppliers on the framework to quote.</p>

            <h3 class=\"govuk-heading-s\">Time needed to run a catering procurement</h3>

            <p>When deciding your process, consider how much time you have to spend on the procurement. For example, running a compliant procurement process for catering can take around 6 months for a person or team with enough time to work on the procurement most days. Running your own procurement can also be a complex process, with a lot of different things to consider, but there is additional support available alongside this manual if you get stuck.</p>"

              <li>Tackling workforce inequality - by paying a fair wage and avoiding zero-hour contracts for catering staff</li>
              <li>Improving health and wellbeing - by providing healthy meals for pupils, contributing to the curriculum to get pupils interested in food, or hosting cooking classes for parents</li>
